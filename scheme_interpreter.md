## Scheme Programming Language Interpreter Project
## Course: CSSE304 - Programming Language Concepts
*Completed in Fall 2019-20*

**Please note that I cannot share the source code or files for this course project due to academic integrity regulations at Rose-Hulman.**

### Project Description
The Scheme Programming Language Interpreter project takes any string representing Scheme code and parses, validates, and executes that code as if it were executed in regular Scheme. The interpreter provides support for all forms and variations on the Scheme expressions taught in the course, including function & variable definitions, function calls, let & let* expressions, datatype definition and usage, and all basic operations (such as list operations, arithmetic operations, type checking operations, etc). This is achieved through a recursive parser, syntax expansion, and expression evaluation using datatypes for various syntactic forms. 

This interpreter was first implemented using recursion, but was later converted entirely to Continuation Passing Style (CPS). It also provides support for variable scoping, value assignment, and variable value accesses by using environments and closures. 

Our team received a high A on this project for meeting all milestone deadlines and requirements, and even earned extra credit for consistently turning in milestones early. This was an especially impressive accomplishment given that CSSE304 is considered the hardest course in the Rose-Hulman CSSE curriculum. 

### My Contribution
TODO edit this

I came up with and implemented many of the ideas tested during the experimentation process. I used my findings from these experiments, along with my knowledge of sentence and essay structure both from previous English courses and from research for this project, to iteratively improve my model for generating accurate and reliable scores. Additionally, I made significant contributions to the written report. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used

*Programming Languages* <br>
Java - This project was implemented fully in Java, per project requirements. 

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - I used GitHub to collaborate with my teammate for this project and ensure that our work was up to date while working in parallel.

*Editing Tools & Environments* <br>
Eclipse - I used the Eclipse editor for writing Java code for this project. 

*Other Technologies Used* <br>
Stanford NLP Kit - I used the Stanford NLP kit to produce parse trees and extract some other raw information that my program used to grade summaries.
