### Project Description
The Essay Grader NLP project is a program developed and tested in Java that uses the Stanford NLP kit to assess whether a document represents a summary of a larger document and assign that document a grade based on how good of a summary it is. The goal of the assignmend was to study and evaluate NLP and its usefulness in the common task of text summarization, while also learning about important concepts from Artificial Intelligence and NLP such as parsing and information extraction. The project submission was also accompanied by a report documenting the team's experimentation and iterative improvement process in order to create a successful grading program. 

Our team received an A on this project for using a combination of entities, parts of speech, and parse trees to reliably produce scores above 75% for admissible summaries and low scores otherwise. 

### My Contribution

I contributed to nearly all parts of this project, while also splitting work fairly with my 3 teammates. 

My team and I worked together to design our hardware architecture as well as the instruction set that accompanied it. We iteratively improved and corrected our design as we stepped through the execution of single instructions all the way to execution of complex programs such as the Euclid's Algorithm benchmark program written in our own assembly language. 

I implemented, debugged, and tested the following individual components independently (using Verilog and Xilinx):
Control Unit
Memory Unit
Resettable Register
Multiple-Input Multiplexors
Sign & Zero Extenders

I also implemented, debugged, and tested the most complex of the three intermediate integration stages specified by our group during the design process (which handled all memory operations, as well as the system output signal), and helped to debug the two other stages (including the program counter updating stage and the arithmetic stage). 

During the final integration stage, when all three intermediate stages were put together to create the full processor system, our team worked together to test and debug the full project, taking turns at the keyboard. We iterated this process until we had a fully functional processor that could correctly run the benchmark Euclid's Algorithm program. 

In addition to my significant technical contributions, I was also the most significant contributor to the project documentation, writing over half of it independently and editing it all for organization, consistency, and grammar before the final submission. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
