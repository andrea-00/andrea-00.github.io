### Project Description
The A* Map Navigation project focuses on the Whistler-Blackcomb Ski Resort, a large skiing area with slopes of all difficulty levels and ski lifts scattered around the two mountains. For the project, this resort was represented as a graph (laid over a map of the actual resort in the user interface) where each "node" represented a notable location (for example, a first aid station, bottom/top of a ski lift, intersection between two or more ski slopes, etc). 

Through the intuitive graphical user interface implemented with Java Swing graphics, users may select a start and end node from the graph and search for the shortest, or longest, path between those nodes. The shortest path would often allow for the fastest travel between two points, while the longest path would often allow for more time on the slopes before reaching the destination. The user may also select from additional filtering and searching options, including finding the nearest first aid station, allowing or disallowing ski lifts on the path, and setting the maximum difficulty level of slopes on the path. 

The searching functionality is implemented through A* and breadth-first search algorithms (A* for finding the shortest/longest path and breadth-first search for finding the nearest first aid station). 

My team received a high A on this project for meeting and exceeding all milestone deadlines and requirements, and even earned some extra credit for implementing additional features such as filters for difficulty and ski lifts; 3 different searching options; and an intuitive and well-designed user interface, among others. 

### My Contribution
I worked primarily on implementing the algorithms for this project. In particular, I implemented and tested the A* algorithm and pair programmed with my teammate for the breadth-first search algorithm, and I also implemented the maximum difficulty level filter. I also made significant contributions to the design of the system and the documentation & final report, and I ensured that our project was as faithfully accurate as possible to the real Whistler-Blackcomb ski resort. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Programming Languages* <br>
Java - This project was implemented in Java, per course requirements, as the course itself was taught in Java. 

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - I used GitHub to collaborate with my three other teammates for this project and ensure that our work was up to date.

*Editing Tools & Environments* <br>
Eclipse - I used the Eclipse editor for writing Java code for this project.
