  Hello! My name is Andrea. Iâ€™m a rising junior at Rose-Hulman majoring in Computer Science, Software Engineering and Mathematics with a minor in Psychology. 
  I am actively looking for an internship in Software Engineering or Technical Program Management, and my professional goal is to become a software engineer or technical PM. 
  Although I have broad experience across the software engineering discipline, including both front-end and back-end development, I also have specialized skills in subjects 
  like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science, among others.
  I also have a significant amount of leadership and community service experience, including current positions as President of the RHIT SASE (Society of Asian Scientists and 
  Engineers) chapter and Co-Founder & Volunteer Program Manager at <a href="https://andrea-00.github.io/backpat">Backpat Volunteer Tutoring</a>. 
  I'd love to get in touch with you! Please feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-wynn/">connect with me on LinkedIn</a> or email me at wynna@rose-hulman.edu.
  Thanks, and I hope to hear from you soon!
