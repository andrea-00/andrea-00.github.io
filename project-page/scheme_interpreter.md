## Scheme Programming Language Interpreter Project
## Course: CSSE304 - Programming Language Concepts
*Completed in Fall 2019-20*

**Please note that I cannot share the source code or files for this course project due to academic integrity regulations at Rose-Hulman.**

### Project Description
The Scheme Programming Language Interpreter project takes any string representing Scheme code and parses, validates, and executes that code as if it were executed in regular Scheme. The interpreter provides support for all forms and variations on the Scheme expressions taught in the course, including function & variable definitions, function calls, let & let* expressions, datatype definition and usage, and all basic operations (such as list operations, arithmetic operations, type checking operations, etc). This is achieved through a recursive parser, syntax expansion, and expression evaluation using datatypes for various syntactic forms. 

This interpreter was first implemented using recursion, but was later converted entirely to Continuation Passing Style (CPS). It also provides support for variable scoping, value assignment, and variable value accesses by using environments and closures. 

Our team received a high A on this project for meeting all milestone deadlines and requirements, and even earned extra credit for consistently turning in milestones early. This was an especially impressive accomplishment given that CSSE304 is often considered the hardest course in the Rose-Hulman CSSE curriculum. 

### My Contribution
I contributed to all milestones of this project and to all the different parts of the interpreter, as listed in the Project Description above. For the majority of this project, I pair programmed with my partner and took turns coding. However, I particularly took initiative on the CPS conversion stage, as my partner had trouble understanding the concepts. When converting the interpreter to CPS style, I both helped my partner understand the concept of CPS through explanations and practice with some carefully chosen examples and drove most of the coding portion of this stage. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Programming Languages* <br>
Scheme - This project was implemented fully in the functional programming language Scheme, per project requirements. 

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - I used GitHub to collaborate with my teammate for this project and ensure that our work was up to date.

*Editing Tools & Environments* <br>
Visual Studio Code - I chose the Visual Studio Code editor for this project, since it had a helpful extension for Scheme that color-coded brackets and parentheses for easier matching.
