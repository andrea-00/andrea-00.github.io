### Motivation for Project
*maybe put my abstract here?*

### Project Description
*TODO edit this*

The Bare-Metal Operating System project is a simple operating system written in 16-bit ANSI C with support for printing, reading and writing using files. Most operations are performed using interrupts. The file system was implemented from scratch, as were basic functions such as printing It also features a command shell and a scheduling algorithm for parallel processing. For this project, I worked with one partner to implement the operating system to meet various requirements for each milestone. 

My partner and I received an A on this project for creating a functional processor that met the project requirements and meeting all intermediate milestone deadlines. 

### My Contribution
*TODO edit this*

I worked on the implementation for all stages of this project along with my partner. I wrote the functions responsible for printing strings, reading and writing using files, and taking and executing commands from the command line, along with some intermediate stages which were used to build up to these functions. I also pair programmed with my partner for the other portions of the project. I also debugged the code after the functions were written, primarily using the print function I implemented in the first milestone of the project due to the lack of a more sophisticated debugging tool for such a low level language.

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Programming Languages* <br>
16-bit ANSI C - This was the language in which the BareMetal Operating System project was implemented, per project requirements. 

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - I used GitHub to collaborate with my partner for this project and ensure that our work was up to date while working in parallel. <br>

*Editing Tools & Environments* <br>
Sublime - I chose to use the Sublime text editor to edit the C files and view assembly language programs for debugging. <br>
Oracle VM VirtualBox (Linux) - All of the code for this project was written in a Linux environment, on a virtual machine provided by Oracle VirtualBox. 

*Other Technologies Used* <br>
QEMU - A generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer supporting x86.
