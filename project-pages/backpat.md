### Overview
When COVID-19 hit, students across the country and the world saw their education heavily impacted by the transition to a fully remote learning environment. This environment was especially challenging for students in grades K-12. In response to this need, I founded Backpat Tutoring, a 100% volunteer-based organization that provides free tutoring services to students in need by pairing up volunteer tutors across the country with students who need academic assistance. <br><br>

Backpat was conceptualized in May 2020 and has now grown to an active organization with a full leadership team and over 350 registered participants, with the number of tutors and students rising every day. The Backpat leadership team is currently applying for 501(c) legal nonprofit status and hopes to become a registered nonprofit organization by the end of 2021.

### My Roles
*Founder* <br>
As the founder of Backpat, I grew the organization from just an idea to a thriving program with hundreds of tutors and students participating. I led the organization through all its recruitment, marketing, and branding efforts, alongside my co-founder Juan Alega and our lead engineer Yasaman Mostafavi. 

*Volunteer Coordination Manager* <br>
During my time with Backpat, I did a lot of work related to volunteer recruitment and outreach; organizing and running the new tutor orientation process; organizing social events for tutors; and being the primary point of contact for new tutors and students. 

*Engineer* <br>
Starting in January 2021, I began working with the web development team at Backpat to help build the new website that would provide functionality to allow the organization to scale up much faster while also providing a more seamless and personalized experience for students and tutors. The website is scheduled for an initial release in mid-March of 2021, and further updates will be released incrementally throughout the year.
