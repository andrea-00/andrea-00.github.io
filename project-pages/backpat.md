### Overview
When COVID-19 hit, students across the country and the world saw their education heavily impacted by the transition to a fully remote learning environment. This environment was especially challenging for students in grades K-12. In response to this need, I founded Backpat Tutoring, a 100% volunteer-based organization that provides free tutoring services to students in need by pairing up volunteer tutors across the country with students who need academic assistance. <br><br>

Backpat was conceptualized in May 2020 and has now grown to an active organization with a full leadership team and over 350 registered participants, with the number of tutors and students rising every day. The Backpat leadership team is currently applying for 501(c) legal nonprofit status and hopes to become a registered nonprofit organization by the end of 2020.
