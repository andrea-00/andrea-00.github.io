### Project Description
The Essay Grader NLP project is a program developed and tested in Java that uses the Stanford NLP kit to assess whether a document represents a summary of a larger document and assign that document a grade based on how good of a summary it is. The goal of the assignmend was to study and evaluate NLP and its usefulness in the common task of text summarization, while also learning about important concepts from Artificial Intelligence and NLP such as parsing and information extraction. The project submission was also accompanied by a report documenting the team's experimentation and iterative improvement process in order to create a successful grading program. 

Our team received an A on this project for using a combination of entities, parts of speech, and parse trees to reliably produce scores above 75% for admissible summaries and low scores otherwise. 

### My Contribution
I came up with and implemented many of the ideas tested during the experimentation process. I used my findings from these experiments, along with my knowledge of sentence and essay structure both from previous English courses and from research for this project, to iteratively improve my model for generating accurate and reliable scores. Additionally, I made significant contributions to the written report. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Programming Languages* <br>
Java - This project was implemented fully in Java, per project requirements. 

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - I used GitHub to collaborate with my teammate for this project and ensure that our work was up to date while working in parallel.

*Editing Tools & Environments* <br>
Eclipse - I used the Eclipse editor for writing Java code for this project. 

*Other Technologies Used* <br>
Stanford NLP Kit - I used the Stanford NLP kit to produce parse trees and extract some other raw information that my program used to grade summaries.
