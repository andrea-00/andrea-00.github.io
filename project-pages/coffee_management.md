### Project Description
The Coffee Management software system architecture and design project features the full implementation of a scalable Internet-of-Things coffee machine management system, which connected coffee machines with suppliers and system administrators to help streamline operations. 

The system implements multiple software design patterns (including the Strategy pattern, Decorator pattern, and Observer pattern), and a full scalable architectural design that includes a fully documented software architecture development process which considered factors such as quality attributes and client-prioritized features to design a flexible, scalable, and robust system. 

### My Contribution
I contributed to all parts of the project by working with my teammates to develop the system architecture at each step. Additionally, I implemented the Observer pattern using Java's Observer class, and took charge of the architecture planning meetings by leading my teammates through the Architecture Driven Design process. Additionally, I developed and implemented the testing plan for the project, including unit tests. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Programming Languages* <br>
Java - The programming language Java was used to implement the system. 

*Software Design Patterns* <br>
Strategy Pattern - This pattern was used to assign coffee making abilities to machines at runtime instead of compile time.  <br>
Decorator Pattern - This pattern was used to add toppings to Drink objects, such as whipped cream and extra espresso shots.  <br>
Observer Pattern - This pattern was used to notify suppliers whenever a specific coffee machine's coffee supply ran out, so that more could be ordered.
