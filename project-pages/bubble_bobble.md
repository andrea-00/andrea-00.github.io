### Project Description
Bubble Bobble is a classic 1984 platform arcade game, remade in this fun and interactive Java project. For this project, the player controls a character who can move about through various levels with platforms to jump on and who can shoot bubbles to trap their enemies. The player may move along platforms, fall to lower ones, and jump to higher ones and over gaps between platforms. Each level has a single screen, and if there is a gap on the bottom edge, the player may jump through the gap and will reappear at the top of the screen. 

Each level has a fixed number of enemies which the player must defeat in order to advance to the next level. The player defeats enemies by blowing bubbles to trap them, then bursting the bubbles by colliding with them. Each enemy defeated drops a fruit that can be collected for extra points. Enemies also have a small chance to drop a special magical item that gives the player special abilities for a short period of time. 

The player loses a life every time they touch any non-bubbled enemies or any bullets that the enemies shoot. The enemies wander about the screen randomly until the player comes within a certain pixel distance of them, at which point they actively chase the player until the player gets out of range. 

My team received a high A on this project for meeting and exceeding all milestone deadlines and requirements. We also implemented additional features such as a scoreboard and a final boss level which, although not worth points, enhanced gameplay and helped us gain additional experience with programming. 

Please note that this project is slightly modified from the game's original version in order to fit the scope of a 3-week course project. 

### My Contribution
For this game, I implemented most of the functionality for the game itself, while my partner implemented more of the user interface and graphics. For instance, I implemented collision checking, bullet and bubble shooting, special abilities with timers, motion (left/right/jump) for the player, and motion for the enemies, among other features. I also wrote the majority of the documentation and final report and debugged the project after all components were put together. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Programming Languages* <br>
Java - This project was implemented in Java, per course requirements, as the course itself was taught in Java. Java Swing was used for the graphical user interface. 

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - I used GitHub to collaborate with my teammate for this project and ensure that our work was up to date.

*Editing Tools & Environments* <br>
Eclipse - I used the Eclipse editor for writing Java code for this project.
