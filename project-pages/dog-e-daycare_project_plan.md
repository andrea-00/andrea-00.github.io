### Project Description
The Dog-eDaycare software project plan features a full project plan for a large-scale software project, the Dog-eDaycare system (DeDS). The Dog-eDaycare System (DeDS) is a web application that provides a one stop shopping center for all dog-related products, from food and medicine to toys and Halloween costumes. For this course project, I created a Software Project Management Plan that describes the goals and objectives, scope and constraints, detailed time and resource estimates, risk analysis, risk mitigation plans, and project schedule (with Critical Path Method analysis) of the DeDS project. The document also discusses the quality assurance process for the project, and conducts Earned Value Analysis for the project at a certain point in development. 

Throughout the project, I worked with my team members to analyze the project's requirements, goals, constraints, and context to produce the full project plan described above. The project scope section included a discussion of the major features and benefits provided by the system, as well as additional enhancements to add if time and budget allows, context for the project, and the constraints, including business, technical, and performance constraints. 

The project estimates were primarily based on historical estimates of similarly large-scale software projects and other parameters such as the average salary of a software engineer. The COCOMO-II estimation method was employed, as well as process-based estimation, and these two estimation methods were triangulated to form the final project schedule and resource consumption estimates. 

Project risks were categorized, analyzed, and ordered in a table by a risk value (calculated using the exposure and impact of each risk). For those risks with the highest risk values, a risk monitoring, mitigation, and management plan was developed, which included a description of the risk, detailed context, mitigation/monitoring strategies, and a contingency plan with a specific and measurable trigger. 

The project schedule provides the basis for deliverable dates and expected resources to be available. It consists of a Gantt chart, which associates resources to projects and provides an approximate schedule, and a Critical Path diagram, which indicates which tasks form the critical path and cannot be delayed. All data in the charts comes from the project estimates developed in an earlier section. 

And finally, the last section of the project primarily addressed tracking and control mechanisms, including quality assurance and change management strategies. Additionally, earned value analysis was conducted for the project at a specific point in development. 

Our team received a high A on this project for meeting and exceeding all milestone deadlines and requirements, and for our attention to detail in the project plan, as well as our engaging and informative final presentation.

### My Contribution
I was primarily responsible for writing the project risks and tracking & control sections, although I helped with the creation and editing of all portions of the project plan. 

For the project risks section, I first developed a list of potential risks to the project and defined major categories those risks would fall into. For example, some of the potential risks I identified included the risk of compromising private user data and of being unable to support a large number of concurrent users. 

For each of the 10 potential project risks I identified, I categorized them and rated their exposure (probability of occurrence) and impact level, multiplying these to obtain a risk value. 

For the top 4 risks with the highest risk values, I developed detailed risk information sheets which included a description of the risk, detailed context, mitigation/monitoring strategies, and a contingency plan with a specific and measurable trigger. 

For the tracking & control section, I developed and recorded a comprehensive quality assurance plan, as well as a single-channel change management plan. The quality assurance section included recommendations such as frequent client communication, careful design reviews, and a thorough test suite that is run before every release and prototype. The change management plan involves a single channel for centralized change management, through which all changes must be approved by the client and key stakeholders, the project manager, and the team's developers before being officially added to the requirements document. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Project Management Tools* <br>
Microsoft Project - This is a sophisticated project management tool in the Microsoft Office suite which provides many useful features for project management. Specifically, I used this to develop project schedules in the form of GANTT charts.
