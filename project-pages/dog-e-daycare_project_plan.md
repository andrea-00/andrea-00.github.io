### Project Description
The Assay Management Software Requirements Engineering project features a set of requirements developed over 8 weeks through communication and requirements elicitation, via emails and video interviews, with clients from Terre Haute Labs, a local assay development laboratory. The final product features a set of traced and client-verified needs, features, software requirements, use cases, user scenarios, SIPOC models, feature prioritization lists, and a full release plan for the final product. 

Throughout the project, I worked with my team members to determine the client's needs for the software, identify the key features of the system, identify and interview key stakeholders, develop software requirements (including non-functional requirements and Shall statements according to IEEE standard), and develop a release plan for the project. Throughout the course of the project, we verified every piece of the resulting documentation with the client and key stakeholders, and adapted the requirements and feature lists based on the changing needs of the stakeholders. We conducted multiple client interviews throughout this process and also added new stakeholders and clients to the system during iteration. 

Our team received a high A on this project for meeting and exceeding all milestone deadlines and requirements, and for impressing the client with our attention to detail and commitment to client satisfaction.

### My Contribution
I worked on all portions of the requirements documentation, including needs, features, stakeholder interviews, writing requirements and use cases, developing user scenarios, feature prioritization, and release planning, with client verification of all of the above. I worked the most closely with the assay development lab manager, who was the primary client for the software project, and communicated with him frequently regarding the progress of the project requirements, ensuring that he approved of all actions taken before changes were made to requirements. Additionally, towards the end of the project, I took on additional responsibilities by being primarily in charge of handling updates to the requirements documents based on input from new stakeholders or changing needs of existing stakeholders. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
*Requirements Management Tools* <br>
Requirements Manager - This is a basic requirements management tool which allows for inputting needs, features, software requirements, and other requirements documentation, along with the ability to trace between various parts of the requirements to ensure traceability. This was used to input most of the final requirements items, per assignment requirements. <br>
