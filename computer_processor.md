## Computer Processor Project
## Course: CSSE232 - Computer Architecture
*Completed in Winter 2019-20*

**Please note that I cannot share the source code or files for this course project due to academic integrity regulations at Rose-Hulman.**

### Project Description
The Computer Processor project is a simple yet fully functional computer processor, built from scratch using an accumulator architecture and a fully customized assembly language. This assembly language features 17 unique 16-bit instructions and support for procedures, calls, loops, and other essential functionality for any processor. The processor was tested for efficiency and functionality by running a benchmark program written in the processor's assembly language to compute relatively prime values using Euclid's algorithm. The processor comes with full, highly detailed documentation that includes specifications for all instructions, hardware, and testing procedures. 

### My Contribution
TODO edit this
I worked on the implementation for all stages of this project along with my partner. I wrote the functions responsible for printing strings, reading and writing using files, and taking and executing commands from the command line, along with some intermediate stages which were used to build up to these functions. I also pair programmed with my partner for the other portions of the project. I also debugged the code after the functions were written, primarily using the print function I implemented in the first milestone of the project due to the lack of a more sophisticated debugging tool for such a low level language. 

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used
TODO edit this
*Programming Languages* <br>
16-bit ANSI C - This was the language in which the BareMetal Operating System project was implemented, per project requirements. 

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - I used GitHub to collaborate with my partner for this project and ensure that our work was up to date while working in parallel. <br>

*Editing Tools & Environments* <br>
Sublime - I chose to use the Sublime text editor to edit the C files and view assembly language programs for debugging. <br>
Oracle VM VirtualBox (Linux) - All of the code for this project was written in a Linux environment, on a virtual machine provided by Oracle VirtualBox. 

*Other Technologies Used* <br>
QEMU - A generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer supporting x86.
