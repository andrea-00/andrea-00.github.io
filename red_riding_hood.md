## Red Riding Hood

### Project Description
COVID has caused an increase in food insecurity around the country. Food banks and pantries have adjusted their operations to accommodate this increased demand. They have done this with fewer volunteers because most of their regular volunteers are high-risk and encouraged to stay home.
<br><br>
Red Riding Hood is an app that is designed to streamline the process of food selection and delivery for food pantries. Customers can select specific baskets of food that the pantry has in stock based on their dietary restrictions and select a preferred pick-up time.
<br><br>
This project started as a competition submission for the TechPointX SOS Challenge in the summer of 2020. This challenge sought to bring students together to address novel challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. After the conclusion of the challenge, I am continuing to work on this project with my team members in the hopes that this app will benefit food banks both during and after this crisis.

### My Contribution

I implemented many of the features of the product, including the grocery bag selection page and time & date selection pages for customers, and worked with team members to create and implement technical specifications for the project overall. I helped facilitate meetings for the Pro team, including Agile-style planning sessions. I also wrote and presented all the technical portions of the final presentation for the team's SOS challenge submission.
<br><br>
Moving forwrard, I will continue to work with the team on building the app and preparing it for deployment to assist with food banks' operations. Our team is continuing to iteratively improve the app as well based on feedback from user testing, both by food banks and by food bank customers.

### Why Red Riding Hood?

Food banks and pantries are especially struggling to respond to the COVID-19 crisis, as they must meet increased demand with a reduced volunteer group while also completely changing their usual methods of operation. Based on research conducted by Red Riding Hood team members, food pantries have adapted to COVID in the following ways:

-Created mobile pantries to deliver food to those who could not travel to a regular serving site
-Recruited younger volunteers who would be at less risk than regular older volunteers
-Created pre-packaged bags of food to be handed out in a drive-through

Based on this information, the team decided to design an app that would allow people to select the type of food they received while streamlining the delivery process for volunteers. Thus, we created an UberEats-inspired mobile app for food pantries. This app was developed partially in response to communications between team members and the Gleaners food bank in Indiana, which provided greater insight to the current needs of food banks and helped to direct the design and development of the Red Riding Hood app.


### Development Process

Once our team identified a need for food banks to better track, verify, and synchronize orders to handle increasing demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to design an app that would help take pressure off food banks and allow them to more efficiently and effectively serve their communities.

The first stage of building the solution was to build a low-fidelity prototype for the app. In the first stages, the design consisted of multiple sketches of various app screens along with descriptions of their purpose and sequence. The Pro team then spent the following week creating a quick and simple prototype with only the most basic features (i.e. no backend database or “real” functionality, just a simple demonstration of the most basic features of the user experience). This initial prototype served as both a proof of concept and a platform that could be used to gather initial feedback from user testing. The team then asked users to test the app by performing certain tasks with it and gathered feedback on usability, how intuitive the design was, and any bugs or issues the testers encountered. The team then collected and prioritized this feedback to create a set of new tasks and bug fixes in response to user feedback while continuing to work on other app features and functionality.

The development process followed by the technical team is modeled after Agile software development. Each week, the technical team met to discuss goals for the week and assign mini-tasks to each member of the team to work on during the week. The team had a daily standup meeting as well, where each team member shared their current progress with their tasks and any roadblocks or issues they encountered. The team tracked all tasks through a Trello board, which was structured as a simplified variation of a Jira board used in the software engineering industry. I facilitated and led these meetings, and I also helped to create user stories and break down larger goals into specific individual tasks that could be assigned to team members (including myself) to work on individually. 

Throughout the course of the SOS challenge, the Red Riding Hood team gained significant valuable experience in a wide variety of domains and areas. All members of the team gained experience working effectively as a team despite the unique challenges posed by the circumstances. Despite the lack of in-person meetings and limited collaborative group work time, the team learned to work effectively by utilizing group meeting time for planning and delegating tasks, and having team members complete the majority of tasks individually. Additionally, the technical team members all learned new technical skills, such as how to use various technologies, including Firebase, Model-View-ViewModel architecture, and Android Studio.

### Technical Architecture and Tools Used

The Red Riding Hood team used the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, adapted for Android, to structure the project. This architecture provides a framework for building robust, scalable, and production quality apps. More details about this architecture may be found <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide">here</a>.

*Version Control* <br>
GitHub - The team chose to use GitHub for version control in collaboration with multiple developers. The GitHub repository with the source code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/sodonova/CommunityNonprofit10">here</a>.

*Editing Tools* <br>
Android Studio - The team chose to use Android Studio because it is designed for building Android apps and has an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. 

*Programming Languages* <br>
Java - The developers all had prior experience with this language, so it was a logical decision to use Java for the app. Android Studio also provides additional documentation to help developers create apps. <br>
XML - This language was used to build the front-end user interface for the app.

*Back-end Database* <br>
Firebase - The team chose Firebase Firestore for the backend database because it integrated easily into Android Studio and it handles data well for the purposes of the app. Firestore is a NOSQL database, a non-relational database that supports high volume usage and easy scalability.

*Task Management* <br>
Trello - The team used Trello to distribute tasks and keep track of progress throughout the project. The Trello board was set up and used in an Agile-style fashion throughout the 5-week challenge, and the team continues to use this tool to keep track of tasks, future goals, and bugs that need to be fixed.
